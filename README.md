# QUILL: Work Stealing Runtime for async-finish Parallelism
A library-based, new concurrency platform supporting async-finish task parallelism. Implemented a work-stealing technique for task scheduling to solve the famous NQueens problem.

#### Execution time for QUILL_WORKERS = 1

## Graph between No. of QUILL_WOKERS vs Execution Time
The graph clearly shows that we achieved linear speedup upon increasing the no. of QUILL_WORKERS/Threads.
